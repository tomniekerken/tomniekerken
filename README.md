### Who I am

- :de: As a knowledgeable 21 year old young talent I currently live near Hamburg, a famous city in Germany

- :man_student: I studied at the SAE Institute Germany from 2020 to 2022 and was successfully awarded my **Diploma** and **Bachelor of Science** in Webdesign & Development

- :computer: Web programming in the frontend as well as in the backend is my area of expertise, but I also like to educate myself in other areas further.

- :memo: In my free time, I like to solve problems, accept new challenges on e.g. Google Codelabs and think about complex systems.

- :scroll: Also, I absolutely love reading relevant studies (not only related to programming) to gather more useful knowledge in this big world!

- :mailbox: Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/tom-niekerken).
